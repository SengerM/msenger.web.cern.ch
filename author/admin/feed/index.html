<p>Many people when starting to work on radiation detectors encounter very rapidly the issue that the Landau distribution is not (efficiently) available in the standard Python package SciPy. There are a number of independent implementations around, and we end up using one of these. In my case, I always used <a href="https://github.com/SengerM/landaupy" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/SengerM/landaupy">landaupy</a> because it is easy to install and to use. </p>



<p>It would be really nice to have the Landau distribution as part of SciPy, wouldn&#8217;t it? Well, there is <a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/19145">a pull request</a> that would integrate it in the standard SciPy package, thus making it trivially available for all Python users. If you find this useful, go to <a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/19145">the pull request</a> and give it a <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="üëç" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> so they get more incentive to add it.</p>

<p>Recently I came across the problem of having to precisely measure the charge produced by a PIN detector from the RD50 FBK TI-LGAD production. As we know, PINs have no internal gain and since this one is from the TI-LGAD production it is only 45 micrometers thick. Thus, the signals are really small and the Landau distribution partially overlaps with the noise, making it very difficult to precisely perform the fit. Fortunately, I came across with a method to actually perform the fit, which is probably a common technique for those doing their PhDs on data analysis but it is the first time I apply such kind of technique to LGADs (or PINs actually) so I want to keep a record of it. I developed this method while characterizing the gain of the new Chubut 2 board (soon more info &#8217;bout it) but it will be useful when dealing with irradiated LGADs as well, since they tend to loose the gain.</p>

<p>For a project I will hopefully present and describe in a future post, we need to measure a &#8220;large&#8221; number of channels with similar characteristics as we currently do with out LeCroy oscilloscopes (see some previous posts). &#8220;Large&#8221; here means on the order of 8-16 channels, which becomes a bit too much for doing with oscilloscopes. So I am testing alternatives such as the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.caen.it/products/dt5742/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.caen.it/products/dt5742/" target="_blank">CAEN DT5742 digitizer</a>. I recently talked with CAEN and they arranged things so I can test a unit before buying it, to be sure it will fit our needs. </p>

<p>So far, for all sensor studies, I have been using either a single channel active board (Santa Cruz or <a href="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/the-chubut-board/" data-type="post" data-id="752">Chubut</a>) or a multi channel passive readout board. Though this works, it is not ideal. Firstly, the passive readout board is not the best because usually the amplifier is installed as close as possible to the readout board. Moreover, if the board is changed for different studies then it is an additional variable to take into account when looking at the results. The ideal case would be a multi channel readout board with amplifiers integrated on the board itself. So I decided to solve this and implemented the &#8220;Chubut 2 prototype&#8221;.</p>



<p>Below there are some pictures of this prototype:</p>

<p>This prototype has two active channels with integrated amplifiers close to the DUT. It also features a Sensirion humidity and temperature sensor close to the sample to precisely monitor the conditions and, if needed, implement a temperature control (for example in the TCT setup). Additionally, I went for a design that combines a &#8220;main board&#8221; with a &#8220;carrier board&#8221;, which can be seen in the pictures. This I made because to ease the life of the guy that is in the lab testing the devices (i.e. me). The size of this prototype is almost identical to the size of the current <a href="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/the-chubut-board/" data-type="post" data-id="752">Chubut board</a> and I switched to using MMCX connectors because SMA just don&#8217;t fit.</p>



<p>After assembling everything together I verified that not only the board works but it seems to be a bit better than our current boards. Since the design has a carrier board, I mounted a few detectors and tested that it is easy to swap between one another. Then I went for a &#8220;full test&#8221; in the beta setup, for which I installed a TI-LGAD with two out of the four pads connected to the outputs and installed it in the <a href="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/the-robocold-beta-setup/" data-type="post" data-id="944">Robocold setup</a>.</p>



<p>Below there is an example of a signal from a beta particle:</p>



<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 80vh; min-width: 888px; min-height: 444px;" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/n_trigger-871-signal_name-DUT.html"></iframe>



<p>The only detail I don&#8217;t like is the long tail of the signal, but anyway it does not affect our tests because we only look at the rising edge, and for the charge it only changes the proportionally factor to convert to Coulomb. I still don&#8217;t know where is it coming from.</p>



<p>So far I only measured rigorously one of the two channels, but I verified that both of them work similarly.</p>



<p>If we look at the time resolution measured with our <a href="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/the-robocold-beta-setup/" data-type="post" data-id="944">Robocold setup</a>, we get this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="702" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot_2022-11-20_11-02-24-1024x702.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1006" srcset="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot_2022-11-20_11-02-24-1024x702.png 1024w, https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot_2022-11-20_11-02-24-300x206.png 300w, https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot_2022-11-20_11-02-24-768x527.png 768w, https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot_2022-11-20_11-02-24.png 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>which is pretty good.</p>



<p>The collected charge (in arbitrary units) also looks quite good, despite the long tails in the signals:</p>

<p>The Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is also amazingly good. For example, at the highest voltage for the device I tested it became even better than for the MCP-PMT in our setup, which is usually not the case. See the plot below.</p>

<p>To conclude, just to mention that this design should be easily scalable to an arbitrary number of channels, as long as there is space in the board to put the components.</p>

<p>A week ago I posted about the Robocold setup in <a href="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/the-robocold-beta-setup/" data-type="post" data-id="944">this post</a>. Now I have coded further in the control software for it and it is capable of performing automated beta scans on all the detectors. Using this, I have done a beta scan on each of the (working) detectors that are installed at the moment. Such detectors are, one non irradiated from the CMS ETL Market Survey from the UFSD4 production, and four detectors irradiated all to different fluences from the UFSD3.2 production, which have been annealed at room temperature for &#8220;a long time&#8221;. It has to be noted that these scans don&#8217;t have &#8220;a lot&#8221; of statistics, at the time I am writing this I am repeating the scans but with more events each.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/collected_charge.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-982" width="653" height="611"/><figcaption>Collected charge as a function of the bias voltage measured automatically with the Robocold beta seutp.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As seen in the plot above, the collected charge makes sense, at least qualitatively, taking into account the irradiation levels. The time resolution shown below is also consistent, at least qualitatively, with the irradiation levels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/time_resolution.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-984" width="658" height="569"/><figcaption>Time resolution as a function of the bias voltage measured automatically with the Robocold beta seutp.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, to understand why the time resolution gets worse when the bias voltage is &#8220;very high&#8221; even though the charge is bigger we can look at the noise:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/noise-1.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-995" width="677" height="552"/><figcaption>Noise as a function of the bias voltage measured automatically with the Robocold beta seutp.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As can be seen, the noise increases beyond certain value. This is because the devices go very close to breakdown and fake spikes appear which are not related to beta particles but to thermally induced avalanches.</p>



<p>The IV curves of these devices are shown below.</p>



<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 80vh; min-height: 333px; min-width: 555px;" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iv_curves-1.html"></iframe>



<p>With the setup in the current status, the required working time to go from the detectors to these results is about one day as it is highly automated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In this post I will present <em>the Robocold beta setup</em> a.k.a. <em>the LGAD long term test setup</em>, <em>LGAD stability test setup</em>, etc. The first presentation of this setup I made it about one year ago in <a href="https://sengerm.github.io/html-github-hosting/210805_long_term_measurements_setup_commisioning/setup_commissioning.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://sengerm.github.io/html-github-hosting/210805_long_term_measurements_setup_commisioning/setup_commissioning.html">this link</a>. After that, other projects appeared, also the climate chamber was failing, so I ended up delaying the development of this setup a bit. But it is finally here!</p>



<p>The goal of this setup is to host up to 8 DUTs (LGADs) simultaneously, all mounted in readout boards and biased all the time at operating voltage. While in these conditions, periodically perform beta scans on each DUT to study their behavior, mainly charge and time resolution, and monitor at all the time the bias voltage and current of each. All this without having to open the climate chamber, so they can be kept cold at low temperatures and operating continuously during a long period of time (several months). Below there is a picture of the setup:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/robocold_setup_parts.svg" style="max-height: 80vh;"><figcaption>A picture of the whole setup with its parts.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The setup is composed by</p>



<ul><li>Robocold: 2 axes motorized stages holding the boards with the DUTs in fixed positions and moving the beta source and the MCP-PMT to any position. It has a controller to connect it to a PC and control it remotely.</li><li>The Castle: This is the 8 channel RF multiplexer. 8 inputs, one for each DUT, 1 output to the oscilloscope. It is connected via USB to the computer so it can be controlled remotely.</li><li>Two CAEN high voltage power supplies which are controlled by the computer and implement 8 independent high voltage bias channels.</li><li>A <sup>90</sup>Sr beta source.</li><li>A Photonis MCP-PMT which is used as a trigger below the DUTs.</li><li>A LeCroy WaveRunner oscilloscope to digitize the signals.</li><li>A climate chamber to go to low temperatures for tests on irradiated detectors.</li><li>A computer that is in charge of controlling the whole setup automatically.</li></ul>



<p>A simplified block diagram of the setup is shown below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" style="height: 80vh;" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/robocold_setup_blocks-1.svg"><figcaption>Simplified block diagram of the Robocold setup. Not shown: the computer, the climate chamber, Robocold himself.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The beta source and the PMT are mounted such that they move together, as can be seen in the video below:</p>

It allows manual control through the buttons and remote control via the USB connector.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>As of now, the setup is fully operational. I am running it since two weeks in &#8220;test mode&#8221;, i.e. doing a series of tests to validate it. Also refining the software in charge of the automatic control and data processing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First testing results</h2>



<p>The plots below show some measurements that were taken with the setup during the last weeks. As this post is about the setup and not the devices, I will not pay much attention to them. Only to say that all the devices named <code>LTT__</code> are irradiated while the device <code>MS33</code> is not irradiated.</p>



<p>The first plot shows the bias current and voltage of each device as a function of time:</p>



<iframe style="height: 90vh; min-height: 666px; width: 100%; min-width: 999px" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/bias_voltage_and_current.html"></iframe>



<p>This data was taken during a period of 2.5 weeks. Both the voltage and the current are measured periodically in a time interval that can be configured individually for each device (as some are much more stable than others). The setup measures both the mean value and the fluctuations of both the voltage and the current each time. The plot contains error bars for each point, which can be better appreciated by zooming in. The big fluctuations that can be seen here e.g. in the beginning or on August 17 as well are because I was doing some other tests. E.g. on August 17 the craziness is because I measured a set of IV curves, which are shown below.</p>



<iframe style="height: 90vh; min-height: 666px; width: 100%; min-width: 999px" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iv_curves.html"></iframe>



<p>As seen, the setup is capable of measuring the IV curve of irradiated devices (all the <code>LTT__</code> ones) as they have a bigger current, and it can also measure the breakdown voltage of a non irradiated device (the <code>MS33</code>).</p>



<p>During this period of time a number of beta scans were performed also, but only on the <code>MS33</code> device which is non irradiated and was also characterized in the past. The plot below shows the collected charge measured for each of these scans. Here we see that the results are consistent between themselves and also persistent along the time, as the first beta scan (blue) was taken on August 16 and the last one (light blue) on August 21.</p>



<iframe style="height: 90vh; min-height: 666px; width: 100%; min-width: 999px" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/collected_charge_vs_bias_voltage_comparison.html"></iframe>



<p>For the aforementioned beta scans, the time resolution of the DUT (i.e. <code>MS33</code>) was computed, and is shown below. Here we see that the DUT achieves a time resolution of ~(32¬±2) ps, which seems to be consistent with previous results. For the time resolution of the <code>reference_trigger</code>, which is the MPC-PMT, a value of 17¬±2 ps was considered. This number comes from a previous measurement I performed on it.</p>



<iframe style="height: 90vh; min-height: 666px; width: 100%; min-width: 999px" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/time_resolution_vs_bias_voltage_comparison.html"></iframe>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Further development</h2>



<p>As the setup is ready to start working, the only remaining part is the readout board. I designed <a href="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/the-chubut-board/" data-type="post" data-id="752">the Chubut board</a> an year ago for this, which is actually the board in use right now. However, soon I discovered that the available space to fit the samples is very small (I had to do some dirty tricks for the Market Survey samples, and also other samples are not fitting now). So recently I made a version of such board<span class="footnote_referrer"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_944_16('footnote_plugin_reference_944_16_1');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_944_16('footnote_plugin_reference_944_16_1');" ><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_944_16_1" class="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text">[1]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_944_16_1" class="footnote_tooltip">Version 220815 found <a href="https://github.com/SengerM/ChubutBoard" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/SengerM/ChubutBoard">here</a>.</span></span><script type="text/javascript"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip_944_16_1').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_944_16_1', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'top center', relative: true, offset: [-7, 0], });</script> which has a lot more space for the samples. </p>



<p>As the new version of the board is still single channel, and for many applications it would be nice to have multi channel boards, I am also developing the Chubut 2 board which should be similar but with two channels. I also want to include a few other features that will make the life of that guy who is in the lab (i.e. me) much easier, the main one is to aim to a design with a carrier board to mount the samples which in RF is far from trivial.</p>

<p>In the later months we have engaged in the market survey for the sensors of <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/2667167?ln=en" data-type="URL" data-id="http://cds.cern.ch/record/2667167?ln=en">the CMS MTD</a>. A long time has passed since <a href="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/beta-timing-setup-and-data-processing-at-uzh/" data-type="post" data-id="25">my previous post focused on the beta setup</a> and I have learned a lot. However, I was still not able to reach the final expected time resolution for the detectors. After Federico from Torino spent a few days in our lab, for which I am very thankful, we finally were able to set everything up and reach results compatible with theirs (Torino&#8217;s) in our setup. The plot below shows the time resolution obtained for a pair of identical detectors (FBK, UFSD4, T10, GR3_0, deep gain layer):</p>



<iframe style="width: 1000px; height: 666px;" src="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/time_resolution_vs_bias_voltage.html"></iframe>



<p>Two additional points were measured at higher voltages but one of the detectors went into breakdown. As seen, at 180&nbsp;V a time resolution of (31.2¬±1.5)&nbsp;ps was achieved, which is compatible with Torino.</p>



<p>The two devices were mounted in two <a href="https://msenger.web.cern.ch/the-chubut-board/" data-type="post" data-id="752">Chubut boards</a>, respectively, placed one on top of the other such that the betas can go through the two detectors. The first stage amplifier is in the boards themselves, while as second stage amplifier our EBay amplifiers were used. After this, straight into the oscilloscope. The devices were placed inside the climate chamber and the temperature was set to -30 ¬∞C.</p>

<p>There were several reasons why we could not reach the expected time resolution, but among  the most important, and this was a surprise to me, was the vertical scale in our LeCroy WaveRunner 9254M oscilloscope. Surprisingly, if the vertical scale is greater than 100 mV/DIV the noise increases considerably. This is because of some circuitry internal to the oscilloscope, as one can hear a relay switching when this vertical scale value is crossed. Other contributions were the ambient light, the temperature, and we using a reference trigger that was not good enough.</p>

<p>Since we acquired our Photonis PMT I have been experimenting with it, and I noticed that the signals become noticeably smaller if I require the oscilloscope to trigger in coincidence between the LGAD and the PMT than if I trigger only on the LGAD. So I made a beta scan to see how important is this effect in a histogram. I describe my experience in <a href="https://sengerm.github.io/html-github-hosting/220714_PMT_filtering_high_charge_events/index.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://sengerm.github.io/html-github-hosting/220714_PMT_filtering_high_charge_events/index.html">this document</a> which I embed below</p>
