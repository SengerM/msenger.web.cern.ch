Now I have coded further in the control software for it and it is capable of performing automated beta scans on all the detectors. Using this, I have done a beta scan on each of the (working) detectors that are installed at the moment. Such detectors are, one non irradiated from the CMS ETL Market Survey from the UFSD4 production, and four detectors irradiated all to different fluences from the UFSD3.2 production, which have been annealed at room temperature for &#8220;a long time&#8221;. It has to be noted that these scans don&#8217;t have &#8220;a lot&#8221; of statistics, at the time I am writing this I am repeating the scans but with more events each.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/msenger.web.cern.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/collected_charge.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-982\" width=\"653\" height=\"611\"\/><figcaption>Collected charge as a function of the bias voltage measured automatically with the Robocold beta seutp.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As seen in the plot above, the collected charge makes sense, at least qualitatively, taking into account the irradiation levels.
